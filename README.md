# Rpi-web-server
my raspberry pi web server to automate some things on my home.

A few things to note:
1. this is an apache web server.
2. the config files and all security protocols are on the machine, not on this repo, 
which contains code for the front and backends.
3. encrypt is the directory for the ssl version of the website. You must have a username and login to access content here.
4. no-encrypt is the directory for the non-encrypted version of the website.
